Personal Website

This repository contains my personal website, built to showcase who I am, the projects I've worked on, and the skills I'm developing as a computer science student. The site includes sections about me, my portfolio, and ways to get in contact.

I created this website to practice modern web development and strengthen my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also serves as a central place for anyone to explore my work, learn more about my background, and follow my journey in tech.

Feel free to explore the code, check out my projects, or reach out if you’d like to connect!
